# Password Door Lock System

This Arduino project implements a simple password-protected door lock system using a keypad and a servo motor. The door is locked or unlocked based on a predefined password entered through the keypad.

## Features

- Password entry through a 4x4 keypad.
- Servo motor used to control the locking mechanism.
- Simple password validation.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board
- 4x4 Keypad
- Servo motor
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Wiring

- Connect the keypad and servo to the specified pins on the Arduino.
- Adjust pin configurations in the code if needed.

## Getting Started

1. Install the necessary libraries (`Servo` and `Keypad`) in your Arduino IDE.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the output.
4. Enter the predefined password through the keypad to unlock/lock the door.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code or wiring based on your specific requirements.
